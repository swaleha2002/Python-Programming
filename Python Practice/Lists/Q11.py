# What is the difference between a list and an array in Python?

# List: A Python list can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats, objects).
# Array: An array in Python (often from the array module or numpy library) typically contains elements of the same data type.

# How do you remove an element from a list by value? Provide an example.
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'apple', 'mango']
fruits.remove('apple')
print(fruits)
